# 🚀 Intro

Hey folks,

I'm excited to share a new project I'm working on — an **AI-powered Analytics Dashboard** specifically designed for **Chrome Extension developers**!

If you have a Chrome extension under your name, this tool is built with you in mind. It's going to make tracking and analyzing your extension's performance easier and smarter.

I've already outlined the initial plan and scoped the core features.  
**Interested in collaborating or brainstorming ideas?** Feel free to reach out — I'd love to connect!

Cheers,  
**Vivek**

Additionally, there's a **chrome-analytics-scraper** that collects the data needed for this dashboard.  
The scraper is currently **a work in progress**, and you can check it out here: [chrome-analytics-scraper](https://github.com/Vivek205/chrome-analytics-scraper)
